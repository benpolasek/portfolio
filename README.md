# Customer Chrun Case Study
A phone company has tasked us with creating a predictive model to predict customer churn based on customer records. 
This case study desonstrates data preperation, data visualization, machine learning, cross validation, model evaluation. 
We then prepare a presentation to help the business make a decesion on how to prevent customer churn
